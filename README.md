This is a Responsive News Collector Web that uses the [News API](https://newsapi.org/) to show the latest headlines and news. Sorted by category.

I made this app using the following tech:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (AJAX, ES6)
* FontAwesome
* Node.js as local server
* Sass ([node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass))

You can check it out on rawgit!
